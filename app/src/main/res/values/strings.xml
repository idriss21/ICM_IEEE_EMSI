        and 1992 respectively. He is currently Research Director at CNRS (French National
        Center for Scientific Research) and works in the Microelectronics Department of the
        Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier (LIRMM) – France.
        He is co-Director of the International Associated Laboratory « LAFISI » (French-Italian
        Research Laboratory on Hardware-Software Integrated Systems) created in 2013 by the CNRS
        and the University of Montpellier 2 with the Politecnico di Torino, Italy. From 2010 to 2014
        , he was head of the Microelectronics Department of LIRMM. His research interests include all
        aspects of digital testing and memory testing, with emphasis on critical constraints such as
        timing and power. Reliability and fault tolerance are also part of his research activities.
        He is Technical Activities Chair of the Test Technology Technical Council (TTTC) of the IEEE
        Computer Society. From 2006 to 2010, he was Vice-Chair of the European TTTC (ETTTC) of the IEEE
        Computer Society. He has served on numerous conference committees and is the founder and Editor-in-Chief
        of the ASP Journal of Low Power Electronics (JOLPE). He is also an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions
        on Computers, IEEE Transactions on CAD and the Journal of Electronic Testing
        – Theory and Applications (JETTA – Springer). He has supervised 33 PhD dissertations
        and has published 6 books or book chapters, 60 journal papers, and more than 200 conference
        and symposium papers on these fields. Patrick Girard is a Fellow of IEEE and a Golden Core Member of the IEEE Computer Society.
